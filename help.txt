Configuring permissions using the ACL shell

First, find the IDs of each group you want to grant permissions on. There are several ways of doing this. Since we will be at the console anyway, the quickest way is probably to run bin/cake acl view aro to view the ARO tree. In this example, we will assume the Administrator, Manager, and User groups have IDs 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

Grant members of the Administrator group permission to everything
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.1 controllers

Grant members of the Manager group permission to all actions in Posts and Widgets
Run bin/cake acl deny Groups.2 controllers
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.2 controllers/Posts
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.2 controllers/Widgets

Grant members of the User group permission to view Posts and Widgets
Run bin/cake acl deny Groups.3 controllers
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.3 controllers/Posts/index
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.3 controllers/Posts/view
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.3 controllers/Widgets/index
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.3 controllers/Widgets/view

Allow all groups to logout
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.2 controllers/Users/logout
Run bin/cake acl grant Groups.3 controllers/Users/logout
